## Genral Purpose RandomForest Class

This example refactors [Rune Madsen's hand-written digit detection example](https://github.com/runemadsen/random-forest-processing-opencv/tree/master/basic_prediction) into a re-usable RandomForest class. Also, hopefully, the structure of this class will act as a template for parallel wrappers for [OpenCV's other machine learning classes](http://docs.opencv.org/java/org/opencv/ml/package-summary.html).
